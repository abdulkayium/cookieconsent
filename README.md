Google Consent Mode V2 is here and mandatory by March 2024. This update ensures compliance with stricter data privacy regulations and impacts how you collect user data for advertising and analytics.

🌼 𝟏𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐲: Cookie Consent - 2024 🚀

🚀 What's New?
Enhanced User Privacy: Consent Mode V2 introduces two new parameters: ad_user_data: controls sending user data for advertising purposes. ad_personalization: controls enabling personalized advertising (remarketing).

Implementation Options: Choose between Basic Consent Mode (no data collection without consent) or Advanced Consent Mode (anonymous data modeling for non-consenting users).

Why is it Important?

Compliance with DMA and GDPR: This update aligns with regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requiring explicit user consent for data collection.

Maintain Data Quality: Without Consent Mode V2, data collection for new EEA users will stop, impacting advertising strategies and measurement in Google Ads and GA4.

How to Implement?

Get a Consent Management Platform (CMP): You'll need a CMP to collect user consent and integrate with Google Consent Mode V2.

Set Up Cookie Banner: A clear cookie banner informing users about data collection and their consent options is crucial.

What About Server-Side Tracking?

Consent Mode V2 applies regardless: User consent is still mandatory even with server-side tracking.

Integration with Consent Mode: Ensure user consent is respected on both client-side (browser) and server-side.

Key Takeaways:

Stay compliant with evolving data privacy regulations.

Respect user privacy with granular consent controls.

Maintain data quality for effective advertising and analytics.

Need Help?

Check your website traffic for EEA users.

Consult a legal team regarding data collection practices.

Consider server-side tracking for enhanced control.

Don't wait until March! Take action now and ensure a smooth transition to Google Consent Mode V2.
